Choosing a name like `c` simply because names `a` and `b` are already taken is not a good practice. It's important to select meaningful and descriptive names that clearly convey the purpose or function of the variable or entity being named.

‘How may strawberries grow in the sea?’

‘As many red herrings as grow in the wood.'”
